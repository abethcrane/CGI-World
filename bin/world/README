== Extensions ==
I have implemented the following extensions:
1. Add an avatar and make the camera follow behind the avatar in a 3rd person view (2 marks)
2. Add a 'night' mode with low ambient lighting. Give the player a torch which shines in the direction they are facing. (2 marks)
3. Make the sun move and change colour according to the time of day (2 marks)
4. Add rain using particle effects (4 marks)

1. Can be found in PersonCamera and Person. The PersonCamera updates the Person when it moves.
2. Can be found in Game.display and Helpers. Helpers updates the day and night, and Game sets the lights appropriately
3. Can be found in Sky (Stars and Sun too), Game and Helpers. Helpers calculates the time of day and the background colour. 
    Sun updates its position depending on the time left in day (interpolates between the two angles). 
    Stars are drawn at night, the percentage increases towards midnight and decreases afterwards.
    The light follows the sun, as seen in Game.display
4. Can be found in Sky, Cloud and Raindrop. Clouds have raindrops attached to them, and draws them unless they touch the ground/go beneath 0.
    The particles movement adjustment can be found in Raindrop.
      
== Cameras ==
As well as a person camera, I have a drone camera available by pressing 'd' and controlled with the mouse. 'p' switches back to person camera.
's' zooms out, 'w' zooms in in drone mode, or tilts up and down in person mode.
'.' increases the speed of the forward/zoom, and ',' slows it down.

== Terrain ==
I've textured the terrain, although I prefer it with the colors. You can toggle between the two with 't'.

== Day/Night Mode ==
I only recently was told that we should add key toggles for extensions. I've added in 'n' to toggle day night mode on and off.
It starts on by default, but can be toggled on and off at any point. When toggling it off the sun resets to the position from the map.
